Upgrade checklist

This file constains a list of system checks that must be performed on upgrading from Liferay 7.1 to 7.4


Deltares checks (before creating db dump for firelay):

- Replace all SearchResults portlets for sites: academy, dsdnl, dsdint and co-udlab
- Setup SAML authentication for all sites (enabled=false) (it is possible to point to existing accounts.deltares.nl)
- Check all Footers
- Update Slides-opensource web content on oss.deltares.nl
- Set correct themes for all sites. (copy all settings as they are lost when switching between themes)
- Import download success page(can be added later). Also configure this in download form
- Import registration success page(can be added later). Also configure this in registration form
- Update ADT Locations map view.ftl for Travel and Stay page (DSDINT and DSDNL)

Deltares checks (after upload to Liferay 7.4 production)
- Enable SAML authentication for all sites (enabled=true)

Firelay checks:

- Create a Google Maps API Key provide this to Deltares.
- Check the version of the 'GeoLite2-City.mmdb' this should be from 12-06-2023
- Check portal-ext.properties file. Request version from Erik
- Check Valve in Tomcat server.xml file. This is to allow caller IPs to be forwarded to backend. Make sure to replace the
  internal proxies.

  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteIpValve" internalProxies="10\.128\.0\.1|10\.129\.0\.1|10\.130\.0\.1" remoteIpHeader="x-forwarded-for" requestAttributesEnabled="true" protocolHeader="x-forwarded-proto" protocolHeaderHttpsValue="https"/>
- Ensure that is possible to create SAML certificates (set owner liferay for keystore.jks )
